# Projects Feature Specification for FreelancerCRM

## üéØ What Project Management Should Actually Do

The Project Management feature is meant to solve the **core operational challenge** that every freelancer faces: **keeping multiple client projects organized, on track, and profitable**. Here's what freelancers are struggling with:

### Current Freelancer Pain Points:
1. **Project chaos** - juggling multiple clients with different timelines and requirements
2. **Scope creep** - projects expanding beyond original agreements without proper tracking
3. **Time management** - not knowing how much time is actually spent on each project
4. **Communication scattered** - project updates lost in email chains
5. **Profitability blindness** - not knowing which projects are actually making money
6. **Deadline stress** - missing deliverables because of poor project visibility
7. **Client expectation mismatch** - unclear project status leading to difficult conversations
